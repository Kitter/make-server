# Allow anonymous FTP? (Beware - allowed by default if you comment this out).
anonymous_enable=NO

# Uncomment this to allow local users to log in.
local_enable=YES

# Uncomment this to enable any form of FTP write command.
write_enable=YES

# Default umask for local users is 077. You may wish to change this to 022,
# if your users expect that (022 is used by most other ftpd's)
local_umask=022

# Uncomment this to allow the anonymous FTP user to upload files. This only
# has an effect if the above global write enable is activated. Also, you will
# obviously need to create a directory writable by the FTP user.
anon_upload_enable=NO

# Uncomment this if you want the anonymous FTP user to be able to create
# new directories.
anon_mkdir_write_enable=NO

# Activate directory messages - messages given to remote users when they
# go into a certain directory.
dirmessage_enable=YES

# Activate logging of uploads/downloads.
xferlog_enable=YES

# Make sure PORT transfer connections originate from port 20 (ftp-data).
connect_from_port_20=YES

# Set to NO if you want to disallow the PASV method of obtaining a data
# connection.
pasv_enable=YES

# If you want, you can arrange for uploaded anonymous files to be owned by
# a different user. Note! Using "root" for uploaded files is not
# recommended!
chown_uploads=NO
#chown_username=whoever

#
# You may override where the log file goes if you like. The default is shown
# below.
xferlog_file={{ vsftpd.serverroot }}/var/log/xfer.log

# If you want, you can have your log file in standard ftpd xferlog format.
# Note that  the default log file location  is /usr/local/vsftpd/var/log/
# xferlog in this case.
xferlog_std_format=YES

# If enabled, two log files are generated in parallel, going by default to
# /var/log/xferlog and /var/log/vsftpd.log.  The former is a wu-ftpd style
# transfer log,  parseable by standard tools.  The latter is vsftpd's own 
# style log.
dual_log_enable=YES

# When enabled, all FTP requests and responses are logged, providing the 
# option xferlog_std_format is not enabled. Useful for debugging.
log_ftp_protocol=NO

# You may change the default value for timing out an idle session.
#idle_session_timeout=600

# You may change the default value for timing out a data connection.

# It is recommended that you define on your system a unique user which the
# ftp server can use as a totally isolated and unprivileged user.
nopriv_user=vsftpd

# Enable this and the server will recognise asynchronous ABOR requests. Not
# recommended for security (the code is non-trivial). Not enabling it,
# however, may confuse older FTP clients.
#async_abor_enable=YES

# By default the server will pretend to allow ASCII mode but in fact ignore
# the request. Turn on the below options to have the server actually do ASCII
# mangling on files when in ASCII mode.
# Beware that on some FTP servers, ASCII support allows a denial of service
# attack (DoS) via the command "SIZE /big/file" in ASCII mode. vsftpd
# predicted this attack and has always been safe, reporting the size of the
# raw file.
# ASCII mangling is a horrible feature of the protocol.
ascii_upload_enable=YES
ascii_download_enable=YES

# You may fully customise the login banner string:
ftpd_banner={{ vsftpd.conf.banner }}

# You may specify a file of disallowed anonymous e-mail addresses. Apparently
# useful for combatting certain DoS attacks.
#deny_email_enable=YES
# (default follows)
#banned_email_file={{ vsftpd.serverroot }}/etc/banned-emails

# You may specify an explicit list of local users to chroot() to their home
# directory. If chroot_local_user is YES, then this list becomes a list of
# users to NOT chroot().
chroot_local_user=YES
#chroot_list_enable=YES
# (default follows)
#chroot_list_file={{ vsftpd.serverroot }}/etc/chroot-list

# If enabled, vsftpd will load a list of usernames, from the filename given
# by userlist_file.  If a user tries to log in using a name  in this file, 
# they will be denied before they are asked for a password. This may be useful
# in preventing cleartext passwords being transmitted. See also userlist_deny.
userlist_enable=YES

# This option is examined if userlist_enable is activated. If you set this
# setting to NO, then users will be denied login unless they are explicitly
# listed in the file specified by userlist_file. When login is denied, the
# denial is issued before the user is asked for a password.
userlist_deny=NO

# This option is the name of the file loaded when the userlist_enable option
# is active.
userlist_file={{ vsftpd.serverroot }}/etc/ftp-users

# You may activate the "-R" option to the builtin ls. This is disabled by
# default to avoid remote users being able to cause excessive I/O on large
# sites. However, some broken FTP clients such as "ncftp" and "mirror" assume
# the presence of the "-R" option, so there is a strong case for enabling it.
ls_recurse_enable=NO

# When "listen" directive is enabled, vsftpd runs in standalone mode and
# listens on IPv4 sockets. This directive cannot be used in conjunction
# with the listen_ipv6 directive.
listen=YES

# When enabled, and vsftpd is started in "listen" mode, vsftpd will background
# the listener process. i.e. control will immediately be returned to the shell
# which launched vsftpd.
background=YES

# This directive enables listening on IPv6 sockets. To listen on IPv4 and IPv6
# sockets, you must run two copies of vsftpd with two configuration files.
# Make sure, that one of the listen options is commented !!
#listen_ipv6=YES

# If enabled, vsftpd will display directory listings with the time in your local
# time zone.  The default is to display GMT.  The times returned by the MDTM FTP
# command are also affected by this option.
